For problem a:
The program is Pj2_a.py.
You can run it directly to get the result.

For problem b:
The program is Pj2_b.py.
You can run it directly to get the shape of TFxIDF matrix to see the number of terms in the documents.

For problem c:
The program is Pj2_c.py.
You can run it directly to see the 10 most important terms in the 4 classes.

For problem d:
The program is Pj2_d1.py and Pj2_d2. 
It will write 2 .csv files which include the matrices after transformation and labels used for 2 class classification 
in problem e to h. Since we have include the .csv files in our submission, you can use these files directly 
for results of problem e to h.We also use program Pj2_d2.py to get 2 .csv files for multiclassification 
in problem i.

For problem e:
File Pj2_e.py solves the problem e)LinearSVM algorithm.
To run this program, you should include the program with "test_out.csv" and "train_out.csv" in the same directory as this program.

For problem f (soft margin SVM):
The program is Pj2_f.py.
Firstly, you should put our .csv files in the same directory as the source code. Then, you can directly run it and get the result.

For problem h (logistic regression):
The program is Pj2_h.py and we use default options for parameters. If you want to see other results based on different parameters, you can specify LogisticRegression().
Firstly, you should put our .csv files in the same directory as the source code. Then, you can directly run it and get the result.

For problem i:
The program is Pj2_i.py. In this program, we try both l1 and l2 norm regularizations and change parameter C from 0.01 to 1000. Also, by changing parameters, the best estimator is found.
Firstly, you should put our .csv files in the same directory as the source code. Then, you can directly run it and get the results based on different parameters and get the best estimator.


For problem g:
File Pj2_g.py solves the problem g)naive Bayes algorithm. 
To run this program, you should include the program with "test_out.csv" and "train_out.csv" in the same directory as this program.

For problem h:
The program is Pj2_h.py.
Firstly, you should put our .csv files in the same directory as this program. Then, you can run the program directly to
get the result.

For problem i:
The program is Project2_i.py. In this program, we try both l1 and l2 norm regularizations and change parameter C from 0.01 to 1000. Also, by changing parameters, the best estimator is found.
Firstly, you should put our .csv files in the same directory as the source code. Then, you can directly run it and get the results based on different parameters and get the best estimator.

For problem j:
Firstly, you should put our multitest_out.csv and multitrain_out.csv in the same directory  as for the following .py files
(1) for Naive Bayes classifier, run the Pj2_j_Bayes.py file to get the result.
(2) for OneVSOne classifier, run the Pj2_j_1v1.py file to get the result.
(3) for OneVSRest classifier, run the Pj2_j_1vr.py file to get the result.
